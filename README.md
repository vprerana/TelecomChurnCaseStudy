# TelecomChurnCaseStudy
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.     In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.
